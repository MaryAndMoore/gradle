/**
 * Implementors of this interface support custom handling of the compound assignment operators ({@code +=, -=}) in Groovy.
 * Groovy doesn't support overloading of just compound assignments, and instead generates a combination of a base operator and an assignment.
 * For example, an expression {@code a += b} is transformed into {@code a = a + b}.
 * <p>
 * A Groovy AST transformation is used to intercept {@code +=}. An expression {@code a += b} is then transformed into:
 * {@code SupportsCompoundAssignment.unwrap(a = SupportsCompoundAssignment.wrap(a) + b)}.
 * When the {@code a} doesn't implement this interface, the functions are no-op.
 * This way you can opt into the custom protocol and provide a dedicated expression value that doesn't have to be the same value that
 * is assigned to the target.
 * <p>
 * Implementing this interface allows an object to provide a stand-in operand for the base operator invocation.
 * The stand-in can implement necessary protocol even if the class itself doesn't overload the operator.
 * <p>
 * Methods of this class are not intended to be called by the handwritten code. The transformed code relies on Groovy's
 * dynamic dispatch to resolve it correctly.
 * As the AST transformation typically doesn't know the type of the arguments, it has to emit the wrap/unwrap calls every time.
 * That's why the class provides the no-op methods.
 * <p>
 * See {@code org.gradle.groovy.scripts.internal.CompoundAssignmentTransformer} for the actual transformation.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the stand-in
