## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating the [Wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) in your project:

```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@ && ./gradlew wrapper
```

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<a name="build-authoring"></a>
### Build authoring improvements

Gradle provides [rich APIs](userguide/getting_started_dev.html) for plugin authors and build engineers to develop custom build logic.

#### Configurations are initialized lazily

Similar to [tasks](userguide/lazy_configuration.html), [configurations](userguide/declaring_configurations.html) are now realized only when necessary.

Starting with this release, applying the `base` plugin (or any plugin that applies it, such as JVM plugins) no longer realizes all configurations declared using `register` or the incubating role-based factory methods.

This change can reduce configuration time and memory usage in some builds.

To leverage these improvements, declare configurations using the `register` method instead of the `create` method:

```kotlin
configurations {
    // Instead of using `create`
    create("myEagerConfiguration")
    
    // Use `register` to avoid realizing the configuration
    register("myLazyConfiguration")
}
```

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

ADD RELEASE FEATURES BELOW

<a name="java-24"></a>
### Support for Java 24

With this release, Gradle supports [Java 24](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/24/). This means you can now use Java 24 for the [daemon](userguide/gradle_daemon.html) in addition to [toolchains](userguide/toolchains.html).

Note that certain features that rely on third-party tools may not work with Java 24 yet.

Warnings about `sun.misc.Unsafe` may appear in some edge cases when using Java 24. These warnings are safe to ignore and will be resolved in future Gradle releases.

See [the compatibility documentation](userguide/compatibility.html#java) for more details.

<a name="Problems-api-additional-data"></a>

### Expanded support for arbitrary data in the Problems API

In Gradle 8.13, we introduced `additional data` support in the public-facing [Problems API](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/32664/javadoc/org/gradle/api/problems/package-summary.html), allowing users to attach extra context to a problem with some limitations.
In this release, those limitations have been removed, enabling the inclusion of `arbitrary data` in a problem.

This enhancement is particularly useful for IDE implementors who manage both the plugin code and its integration via the [Tooling API](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/32664/userguide/tooling_api.html#embedding).

By leveraging this feature, you can provide richer context for problems that are not fully captured by the existing properties.

For example, a worker task may now include more detailed diagnostic information:

```java
public abstract class ProblemWorkerTask implements WorkAction<ProblemsWorkerTaskParameter> {

    // Use the Problems interface to report problems
    @Inject
    public abstract Problems getProblems();

    // Use the ObjectFactory to create instances of classes for composition
    @Inject
    public abstract ObjectFactory getObjectFactory();

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        ProblemId problemId = ProblemId.create("type", "label", ProblemGroup.create("generic", "Generic"));
        getProblems().getReporter().report(problemId, problem -> problem
            .additionalData(SomeData.class, dataInstance -> {
                dataInstance.getSome().set("some"); // Provider API properties can be used
                dataInstance.setName("someData"); // Getters and setters can be used
                dataInstance.setNames(Collections.singletonList("someMoreData")); // Collections can be used
                SomeOtherData compositionDataInstance = getObjectFactory().newInstance(SomeOtherData.class);
                compositionDataInstance.setOtherName("otherName");
                dataInstance.setOtherData(compositionDataInstance); // Composition can be used
            })
        );
    }
}
```

The data interfaces for this example look as follows:

```java
import org.gradle.api.problems.AdditionalData;
import org.gradle.api.provider.Property;

import java.util.List;

public interface SomeData extends AdditionalData {
    Property<String> getSome();

    String getName();

    void setName(String name);

    List<String> getNames();

    void setNames(List<String> names);

    SomeOtherData getOtherData();

    void setOtherData(SomeOtherData otherData);
}

public interface SomeOtherData {
    String getOtherName();

    void setOtherName(String name);
}
```

#### Receiving side on the Tooling API

The [`CustomAdditionalData.get()`](org/gradle/tooling/events/problems/CustomAdditionalData.html#get(java.lang.Class)) method allows you to retrieve additional data using a specified view type.

On the TAPI side, retrieving and using the additional data might look like this:

```java
void someMethod(List<Problem> problems) {
    SomeDataView view = problems.get(0).getAdditionalData().get(SomeDataView.class);
    System.out.println(view.getName());
    System.out.println(view.getNames().get(0));
    System.out.println(view.getOtherData().getOtherName());
}
```

The retrieved data can be structured using view interfaces like the following:

```java
interface SomeOtherDataView {
    String getOtherName();
}

interface SomeDataView {
    String getSome();

    String getName();

    List<String> getNames();

    SomeOtherDataView getOtherData();
}
```

### Configuration Cache improvements

#### Integrity Check mode

When facing cryptic configuration cache loading failures, you can now enable stricter integrity checks with `org.gradle.configuration-cache.integrity-check` property.
It can help to pinpoint the piece of code that failed to serialize properly with more precision. You can get from:
```
Index 4 out of bounds for length 3
```
to:
```
Configuration cache state could not be cached: field `user` of task `:greet` of type `GreetTask`: The value cannot be decoded properly with 'JavaObjectSerializationCodec'. It may have been written incorrectly or its data is corrupted.
```
Enabling the checks inflates the configuration cache entry and slows down storing and loading it, so it should be used as a troubleshooting tool and doesn't need to be permanently enabled.
